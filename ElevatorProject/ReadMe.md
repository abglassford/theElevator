# The Elevator
### Provide code that simulates an elevator.  You may use any language (recommend using java or Python). 

## Assumptions
- Can only accept floors that are whole numbers within configured range
- Building has a basement and upper floors
- The lobby is floor 1
- There is no floor 0
- This is the only elevator to control
    - but there may be more added in the future
- The only functions are to go up and down

## Future Features
- Create an event loop
- Create a queue for concurrent elevator calls
- Handle multiple, simultaneous selections
- Input error handling and validation
- Handle restricted floors
- Handle multiple elevators
